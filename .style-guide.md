# Portfolio Writing Style Guide
## Technical Writer Standards for Professional Project Documentation

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-26
**Purpose:** Single source of truth for all portfolio writing

---

## Voice & Tone Standards

### Core Principles

**Voice Type:** Third-person technical narrator
- ✅ "The framework achieves 84.8% solve rate"
- ❌ "I built a framework that achieves" (first-person)
- ❌ "You can use the framework to" (second-person)

**Tone:** Assertive with evidence-based claims
- ✅ "84.8% SWE-Bench solve rate represents state-of-the-art performance"
- ❌ "This magnificent framework is blazingly fast and excellent"
- ❌ Superlatives without quantification

**Professional Standards:**
- Technical precision over marketing language
- Quantified metrics over subjective assessments
- Present capabilities, not promises
- Evidence-based differentiation

---

## Opening Hook Formula

### Standard Pattern
```
[Domain] [system type] [achieving/demonstrating] [key differentiator with metric]
```

### Examples from Portfolio

**Evolve Framework:**
> Integrated framework combining 54+ specialized AI agents with Byzantine fault tolerance, SPARC methodology, and zero context loss across development sessions.

**AudioEngine:**
> Dual-purpose iOS application implementing both a real-time noise meter and a sophisticated 14-band dual-channel audio equalizer with cloud synchronization.

**LawnTech Dynamics:**
> Combining computer vision biomechanics tracking, autonomous grass court management, and digital twin architecture to deliver professional-grade racquet sports at scale.

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Second-person voice (FlowState issue):**
> "Your brain controls the video speed. Stay focused, content speeds up."

**Fix:**
> "Brain activity controls video playback speed. Focused attention increases playback rate."

❌ **Vague capability claims:**
> "A powerful system for managing tasks efficiently"

**Fix:**
> "Multi-agent task orchestration achieving 4.4x faster execution through parallel coordination"

---

## Achievement Presentation (STAR Method)

### Formula
```
[Action Verb] + [Quantitative Result] + [Context] + [Method] + [Impact]
```

### Examples

**Strong:**
> Built 60-minute autonomous grass court replacement system enabling unprecedented indoor grass court availability through robotic automation and 2,000 m² vertical farming.

**Components:**
- Action Verb: "Built"
- Quantitative Result: "60-minute replacement"
- Context: "indoor grass court availability"
- Method: "robotic automation and 2,000 m² vertical farming"
- Impact: "unprecedented availability"

**Weak (avoid):**
> Created a system for managing grass courts more efficiently.

---

## Metrics Formatting Rules

### Numbers

**Thousands:** Use comma separators
```yaml
✅ 2,347 lines
✅ 2,000 m²
❌ 2347 lines
❌ 2000 m²
```

**Percentages:** One decimal if fractional, no decimals if whole
```yaml
✅ 84.8%
✅ 98%
❌ 84.80%
❌ 98.0%
```

**Multipliers:** Lowercase 'x'
```yaml
✅ 4.4x faster
✅ 2.8x improvement
❌ 4.4X faster
❌ 4.4 times faster
```

**Approximations:** Use '+' suffix for "more than"
```yaml
✅ 54+ agents
✅ 500+ attendees
❌ 54 agents (when it's "more than 54")
❌ over 500 attendees
```

### Technical Specifications

**Hyphenated compound modifiers:**
```yaml
✅ 14-band equalizer
✅ 60-minute replacement
✅ 68-court facility
❌ 14 band equalizer
```

**Spaced measurements:**
```yaml
✅ 60 FPS
✅ 225 km/h
✅ 2,000 m²
❌ 60FPS
❌ 225km/h
```

**Line counts:** Comma + space + word
```yaml
✅ 2,347 lines
✅ 945 lines
❌ 2,347 LOC
❌ 2347 lines
```

---

## Tense Usage Standards

### Present Tense
**Use for:** Current capabilities, system characteristics, demonstrable features

```yaml
✅ "achieves 84.8% solve rate"
✅ "demonstrates Byzantine fault tolerance"
✅ "provides real-time analytics"
❌ "achieved" (when capability still exists)
❌ "has demonstrated" (present perfect is weaker)
```

### Past Tense
**Use for:** Implementation actions, development history, completed work

```yaml
✅ "built autonomous system"
✅ "implemented 14-band equalizer"
✅ "created digital twin architecture"
❌ "was built" (passive voice - avoid)
```

### Passive Voice
**Avoid:** Always prefer active voice

```yaml
✅ "Built 60-minute replacement system"
❌ "A 60-minute replacement system was built"

✅ "Implemented Byzantine fault tolerance"
❌ "Byzantine fault tolerance was implemented"
```

### Mixed Tense (Monument issue)
**Problem:** Inconsistent tense within same section

❌ **Before:**
> Monument demonstrates pixel-perfect implementation. The project was built using AI-assisted workflows. It provides production-ready code.

✅ **After:**
> Monument demonstrates pixel-perfect implementation through AI-assisted workflows, providing production-ready code with accessibility standards.

## Before/After Examples

### Issue #1: Second-Person Voice (FlowState)

❌ **Before:**
> Your brain controls the video speed. Stay focused, content speeds up. Lose attention, it slows down.

✅ **After:**
> Brain activity modulates video playback speed. Sustained focus increases playback rate, while attention lapses reduce speed, providing objective biofeedback for attention training.

### Issue #2: Mixed Tense (Monument)

❌ **Before:**
> Monument demonstrates pixel-perfect UI implementation. The project was built using AI-assisted workflows. It provides production-ready code and has been designed with accessibility in mind.

✅ **After:**
> Monument demonstrates pixel-perfect UI implementation through AI-assisted workflows, providing production-ready code with accessibility standards and systematic design-to-code automation.

### Issue #3: Inconsistent Metrics Formatting

❌ **Before:**
> - 4.4X faster execution
> - 32.3 percent cost reduction
> - 2347 lines of code
> - Over 50 agents

✅ **After:**
> - 4.4x faster execution
> - 32.3% cost reduction
> - 2,347 lines of code
> - 54+ agents

### Issue #4: Opening Hook Variation

**Current variation across projects:**
- Evolve: Technical system description ✅
- AudioEngine: Feature-focused description ✅
- FlowState: Second-person concept ❌
- LawnTech: Multi-capability description ✅

**Standardized approach:**
All hooks should use: `[Domain] [system type] [achieving/demonstrating] [key differentiator]`
